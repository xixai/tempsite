<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here's everything you need to know about the hackathon:</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Recurrent Neural Networks</span></strong></p>

<p class="p2"><span>To make sure the name of the hackathon does not mislead you, it is not necessary to use RNNs in your code, neither it is </span>necessary<span> to use deep learning in general. As long as you use machine learning, your project qualifies.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Registration</span></strong></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Please bring your photo ID and tickets (printing is not necessary, showing on your smartphone or your iPhone is fine) to the event.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><strong>Teaming up</strong></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We encourage you to join the slack channel https://xixslack.herokuapp.com/ (if you haven't dont it yet) and form teams there. If you do not find a team before the event, make sure to show up before 9:30 on Saturday. We will have teams pitch their ideas at 9:30, so that more people can team up together.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While there's no hard limit on a number of teams, there's a limit on available GPU instances provided by NVidia, and larger teams will be given the instances first.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It's highly preferred to form teams, since the amount of time on Sunday is limited, and we only have four judges. We require teams to have at least two members to pitch on Sunday and be eligible for prizes.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Judging</span></strong></p>

<p class="p2"><span>Teams will need to </span><a href="http://recurrent-neural-hacks-3961.devpost.com/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">submit their projects to DevPost </span></a><span>no later than 9:30 on Sunday.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Sunday, teams will be split into several groups, each group pitching to one of the judges. Each judge will choose two projects that advance to the finals. Teams that have advanced will pitch in front of everyone, and the first three places will be announced.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All pitches will be hard-limited to two minutes, followed by a one minute Q&amp;A.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Pokemons</span></strong></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are four pokestops within one block from the venue. The closest Gym is on the third and Bryant (one block away), but there are at least two more in a walkable distance. Pokemons spawn more in densely populated places, and the venue is located in a somewhat densely populated place.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Please do not pokemon and drive.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Workshops</span></strong></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The order of afternoon workshops might change during the hackathon. If you want to attend a pacticular one, make sure to pay attention to announcements during the event.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A corgi named Batman will be assisting with all the workshops.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the pandas, scikit-learn and tensorflow workshops, you need to prepare your laptop beforehand. All three workshops assume you have python installed and are familiar with it. See snipped at the end of this message with instructions on how to install necessary packages.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><strong><span>Food</span></strong></p>

<p class="p2"><span>As was announced, we will be providing lunch, snacks, and dinner on Saturday and breakfast on Sunday. There are also snacks including deep fried </span>oreos<span> at 3am for those who choose to code overnight.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><strong><span>Parking</span></strong></p>

<p class="p2"><span>Parking is never fun in San Francisco. If you are driving from the valley, consider taking CalTrain, the venue is only three blocks away from the 4th street station, and there are always plenty of </span>pokemons<span> on the way.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you end up driving here, there is a paid parking lot under the bridge on the second street between Harrison and Bryant streets. There's also metered parking on most of the streets around. Also remember, that metered parking is free on Sundays, but not on Saturdays.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span>Happy Hacking, people! We'll see you all at the hackathon!</span></p>

<p class="p2"><strong><span>Workshop instructions:</span></strong></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you are interested in taking&nbsp; pandas, scikit-learn and/or tensorflow workshop, please make sure that you run following commands in your shell before going to bed on Friday night:</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">if you are on linux, make sure you have numpy installed with your system's package manager</span></p>

<pre>

# chose your favourite package manager

PYINSTALLER="sudo pip install -U"

PYINSTALLER="sudo pip3 install -U"

PYINSTALLER="sudo conda update"



# install / update following packages

$PYINSTALLER jupyter

$PYINSTALLER pandas

$PYINSTALLER sklearn

$PYINSTALLER matplotlib


</pre>


For tensorflow installation, please check here:

<a href='https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/get_started/os_setup.md'>https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/get_started/os_setup.md</a>
<br>
After installing please open your shell and type

<pre>


python -c "import tensorflow"

#&nbsp; or

python3 -c "import tensorflow"


</pre>



if it exits silently, chances are high that it is installed properly
